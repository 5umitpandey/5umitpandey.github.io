Hello! I discovered my passion for programming during my time at [O.P. Jindal School, Raigarh](http://www.opjstamnar.com/). I completed my schooling there, specializing in the Science stream. Later, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Data Science from [Ajeenkya DY Patil University, Pune](https://adypu.edu.in/) (2020-2023) achieving a CGPA of [8.77]().

Alongside my studies, I had the privilege of being part of a remarkable team that secured the [2nd position](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1urBcCgenKup3xjGC1nGtcpql0-Nko8Xr/view?usp=sharing) in the [Basketball Cluster Competition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dHDpUokP3Xcf37dJYuH8Gtbi26yC0nKX/view?usp=sharing). I also proudly represented Chhattisgarh in the [Inter-State Football Competition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BuzLD5NykhDStPnf65VAFSffwushe-sY/view?usp=sharing) and participated in the [Inter-School Robotics Competition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10KjAIyhjzZF8IsAGsXL_paC2jiV4rKXT/view?usp=sharing).

Currently, I am dedicatedly preparing myself to make a significant impact as a **Data Scientist**. 

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
