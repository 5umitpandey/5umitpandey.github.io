 Developed a real-time Face Mask Detection system capable of accurately identifying face masks in video streams, providing a mask-wearing accuracy score ranging from 0 to 100.

 Utilized a pre-dataset compiled from diverse sources, including Kaggle, AWS, and Google Images, to train the system and ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy in mask detection.
